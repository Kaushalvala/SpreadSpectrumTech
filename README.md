# 📡 Spread Spectrum Techniques: Frequency Hopping & Direct Sequence

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of **Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)** and **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)** techniques. These are popular methods used in spread spectrum communications to ensure secure and interference-resistant signal transmission.

## 📜 Overview

Spread spectrum is a technique used in telecommunications to spread a signal across a wider bandwidth than necessary. This approach helps reduce interference, enhance security, and improve signal robustness against jamming and noise. In this repository, we have implemented two main types of spread spectrum techniques:

- **FHSS (Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum):** 🎶 This technique spreads the signal by rapidly hopping between different frequency channels.
- **DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum):** 🔑 This technique multiplies the signal by a pseudo-random noise sequence that spreads it across a wider frequency band.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### FHSS Simulation

1. Open the `Frequency_hopping_spread_spectrum.m` file in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to simulate the frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication.
3. 📈 View the graphical output that demonstrates the BPSK modulated signal, frequency-hopped spread signal, and the demodulated signal.

### DSSS Simulation

1. Open the `Direct_sequence_spread_spectrum.m` file in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to simulate the direct-sequence spread spectrum.
3. 📊 Observe the graphical plots of the input sequence, pseudo-random noise code, XOR operation, and BPSK modulated signal.

## 🌍 Applications

- **Military Communications:** 🛡️ FHSS and DSSS are widely used in military communications due to their resistance to jamming and interception.
- **Wireless Networks:** 📶 These techniques are also employed in commercial technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to enhance communication security and reduce interference.
